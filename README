Win32/FetchCommand version 0.01
===============================

NAME

Win32::FetchCommand - Perl extension for the Win32 API SearchPath, and 
filename extension association resolution.

SYNOPSIS

  use Win32::FetchCommand;

  @Command  = FetchCommand ('.pl');

  ($Exe, @CmdLine) = FetchCommand ('file.txt');

  ($Exe, @CmdLine) = FetchCommand ('file.txt', 'print');

DESCRIPTION

This module is specifically for use with Win32::Process::Create.  That interface
requires the full path name of an executable, which FetchCommand provides based
on the filename 'extension'.

It is not always obvious (to a program) which executable should be run to process
a given file, so this module provides a registry lookup to get the associated
executable.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module will only run on Microsoft Windows, and requires a C compiler, a
linker, and a 'make' utility for installation.
